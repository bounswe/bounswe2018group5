And had it not been for my Service Dog, I would've laid on the floor and died because he ran and got somebody's attention, bringing them back to me and literally saving my life. After regaining the strength to get back on my Harley, with service dog as a riding partner now, I then was struck by a distracted driver (within my own neighborhood), losing my lower left leg. Despite all that, I drive forward in life, forgetting what has happened to me in the past, and focusing on what's ahead, and what God promises me in Christ Jesus. I immediately forgave the other driver and spend my days advocating awareness regarding distracted driving, mainly to high school/college aged kids, but also inspiring anyone that will listen, that no matter the obstacle, it is possible to have it help you not hurt you! \r",
